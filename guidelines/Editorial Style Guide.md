## Why use the style guide?

If you use the style guide, you'll help us tell the o1.exchange story consistently. You'll also be more likely to get amplification from the o1.exchange core team and other members of the o1.exchange ecosystem.

## About o1.exchange

o1.exchange is the next-generation trading platform built for the DeFi ecosystem, combining institutional-grade infrastructure with an intuitive user experience for traders of all levels.

## Conventions

- Use readable language and grammar.
- Have your post explain the relevance and significance to o1.exchange and its mission.

## What to Avoid

To increase your chances of amplification on social channels, please avoid the following (including in any linked content):

- **Investment Advice**: Avoid providing investment recommendations, calls to action, or investment strategies.
- **Mentioning Specific Tokens**: Focus on your utility, or product experience instead of singling out specific tokens, token rewards, etc. This applies to both written content and product visuals (e.g., screenshots or videos).
- **Disputable Superlatives**: Avoid using unverified superlatives like “the best”, “the first”, “maximize”, “ensure”, etc.
- **Unapproved Partnerships**: Avoid references to a “partnership” or “collaboration” with o1.exchange and instead reference that your project is making use of o1.exchange services.
- **Overly Aggressive Marketing**: Avoid aggressive marketing tactics (e.g., overuse all caps, overuse of emojis, etc.), promotions, and discounts, as they may send the wrong message within the o1.exchange ecosystem.
- **False or Misleading Information**: Ensure all information shared is accurate, truthful, and does not mislead readers.
- **Unsupported Data**: Share the source of any data presented.
- **Negative Comparisons**: Refrain from putting down other projects or competitors.
- **NSFW Content**: Refrain from using offensive, NSFW, explicit language or content in any communication, including your website.
- **Unreleased Products**: Avoid teasers of products that are unavailable for immediate use.
- **Incomplete Posts**: Include all content (i.e., videos, images, linked content, etc.) in your submitted post.
- **Unlicensed IP**: Remove any IP in your post and website that is not properly licensed.
- **No KYC (in Certain Cases)**: Certain applications may be subject to KYC obligations and a clear indication in the beginning of your post that the application is only available to KYC’d/qualified users in order to be eligible for amplification at our sole discretion.

## Tone and Voice

> ”Although tone and voice are often used together, they are not at all the same thing. Voice is the overall personality of your brand and can be described in adjectives like helpful, witty, or friendly. […] your brand’s voice will not change. However, tone, or tone of voice, is the attitude of your writing for a particular content piece.”

- Direct (e.g., using "offers" over "that aims to offer")
- Optimistic but realistic (not overly idealistic)
- Appreciative (not prideful)
- Witty
- Championing of builders
- Relatable (using cultural references familiar to the audience)
- Brief and punchy, with clarity and impact
- Avoids overly technical jargon or corporate talk
- Acknowledges challenges directly but remains solutions-oriented
- Not too casual, but still conversational
- Provides unique, thought-provoking insights
- Engages in trending topics wisely (and rarely)
- Offers compelling reasons to return through memorable and engaging content
- Minimal use of emojis (one at most)

**More on tone and voice**

- [Tone in Writing: A Simple Guide](https://jerryjenkins.com/tone-in-writing/) - ”**…voice is _what_ you say, and tone is _how_ you say it.**”
- [A Word About Style, Voice, and Tone](https://www.umgc.edu/current-students/learning-resources/writing-center/online-guide-to-writing/tutorial/chapter3/ch3-21.html) - “When you hear an author talking inside your head, “voice” is what that author sounds like. \[…] You can develop your own voice in your writing by paying special attention to rhythm, diction, and punctuation.”
- [Point of View](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/point-of-view-first-second-third-person-difference) - First, second, or third person? Omniscient, limited, or objective? Check for consistency.

## Clarity, Concision, and Flow

> “The goal is to make your paper as simple and clear, as immediately intelligible to the reader as possible. This doesn’t mean that you should ignore subtle and sophisticated complexities in your theory – but the challenge is to state those complexities simply and clearly. Avoid making your subject seem more complex than necessary (for example, if something “creates habits”, it’s probably neither necessary nor helpful to say that it “exhibits a habit-formation process”).”

- Strategies for improving sentence clarity include using transitional words, properly placing subordinate clauses, and choosing action verbs over ‘be’ verbs (e.g. is, are).

### [Plain Style](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/writing_style/plain_style%20.html)

Because we specialize in reducing complex topics into concise summaries that are digestible to the average user, o1.exchange encourages contributors to write in plain style. For example: opt for simple words like *use* rather than *utilize*.

### Passive and Active Voice

o1.exchange prefers **active voice**. Sometimes [passive voice can be rhetorically effective](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/active_and_passive_voice/choosing_passive_voice.html), but in most cases contributors should [change passive to active voice](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/active_and_passive_voice/changing_passive_to_active_voice.html).

**Example:**

*   **Original (Passive)**: “Experiences that are sticky, that make it easy for anyone to get started, and that offer a seamless user experience that abstracts onchain complexity as much as possible are what we’re looking for.”
*   **Edited (Active)**: “We’re looking for experiences that make it easy for anyone to get started and offer a seamless user experience that abstracts complexity as much as possible.”

### Tips for Improving Concision

- Avoid redundancies. When in doubt, opt for two shorter sentences over one longer one. The [Hemingway App](https://hemingwayapp.com/) can point out areas for improvement.
- Consult the Purdue OWL page on [concision](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/conciseness/index.html) for examples of “wordy vs. concise” sentences.
- Avoid phrasing that adds little useful information for the reader, such as ending sentences with “…and more.”

### Tips for Improving Flow

- Avoid [sentence fragments](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/sentence_fragments.html).
- [Vary](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/sentence_variety/index.html) sentence structure, rhythm, opening words, and length.

## Nuances

- In general, follow the [Purdue OWL](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/mechanics/help_with_capitals.html) guidelines for capitalization.
- For headlines, use **Title Case**, not sentence case.

## Punctuation

- [Oxford Comma](https://thewritelife.com/is-the-oxford-comma-necessary/): o1.exchange uses the Oxford comma.
  - *Do not use*: apples, oranges and bananas
  - *Use*: apples, oranges, and bananas
- **Em Dashes**: Write em dashes as ( — ). Add spaces on both sides.
  - *Example*: “Facilitators accept responsibility to move groups through an agenda, ensure adherence to mutually agreed-upon process mechanics, and — if necessary — suggest alternates or additional discussion.”
  - Consult [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use) for general guidance on em dashes.
- **Ampersands**: Use ampersands only in business names (e.g., “Tiffany&Co.”) and common abbreviations such as “B&B” or “R&D.” Avoid using ampersands as a substitute for the word “and.”
- **Parentheticals**: [Where to place that period](https://style.mla.org/the-placement-of-a-comma-or-period-after-a-quotation)? As per [Typos of the NYT](https://twitter.com/nyttypos/status/1599500874354954240): “When a sentence ends with a parenthetical, the sentence's period goes outside the parentheses (unless the entire sentence is parenthetical).”
- **Colons and Semicolons**: For lists included as part of the text, use semicolons as separators when at least one of the list items contains a comma. Otherwise, use commas.

## Numbers, Dates, and Times Basics

- **Basics**: Consult the [Purdue OWL](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/grammar/writing_numbers.html) for basic guidelines.
- **Numerals**: Write out numerals 0 through 9 as words: zero, one, two, three, etc.
  - *Exception*: Write 1-for-1, not one-for-one.
  - Write numerals 10 and above as Arabic numerals: 10, 59, 100, 9888, etc.
  - Abbreviate 10,000 and above with a K instead of using a comma (e.g., 100K).
  - Abbreviate 1,000,000 and above with an M.
  - Abbreviate 1,000,000,000 and above with a B.
- **Dates**: Write dates as “September 2, 2022” (or “Sep. 2, 2022”) rather than “September 2nd, 2022.”
- **Time Spans**: Write full-year ranges of time as “2009—2022” with an em-dash and no spaces.
- **Decades**: Write out the first reference to a decade as “1960s” and abbreviate subsequent instances as “60s” (no apostrophe).
- **Clock Times**: Always reference both the period of day and time zone. Period lowercase, time zone uppercase. No space between numeral and period, space before time zone.
  - *Example*: “7am ET”, “1:30am PT”. Default to PT if no location referenced.
- **Software Versioning Prefixes**: o1.exchange uses lowercase version number prefixes (v1, v1.5) rather than uppercase (V1). While there is no fixed standard, most software versioning at a low level uses Semantic Versioning Specification, aka [semver](https://semver.org/).
